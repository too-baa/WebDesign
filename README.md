Web Designing: HTML
1. Basic HTML document (basic.html):
   In this, basic tags like html, head, body, title, heading tags and p for paragraph have been used.

2. Practice document (Practice1.html):
   In this, I have practiced above mentioned basic tags and created a document which gives a brief introduction to Python language.

3. Anchor and Image tags (anchorandimgtags.html):
   In this document, a (anchor tag) has been used to link one page to another by using href (hyperlink reference) property.
An img tag is used to insert an image in the HTML document by using src(source) property which can contain either the address of image(if image is used from the web) or the path of image(if image is stored in PC itself).
Width of image can also be modified by using width property inside the img tag.

4. Ordered and Unordered Lists(olandul.html):
   Ordered list ol tag is used to create a list starting with numbers by default. Inside ol tag, type(such as Roman or alphabets) and start of a list can also be modified.
In an unordered list, ul tag is used and it creates a bulleted list of contents.
Between the opening and closing ol or ul tags, li tags are used to write contents.

5. Practice document(practice2.html):
   In this, I have practiced anchor and image insertion tags and created a document which contains names and posters of 11 Oscar winning movies (from 2010 to 2020). The user can navigate to any movie poster by clicking on its name in the contents.

6.  Table(table.html):
   To create a table in HTML, table tag is used. Inside the table tag, border property has been used to create a border of 1px around each cell.
Caption tag has been used to name the table.
To insert rows, tr tags have been used.
To insert headings, th tags are used alongwith the heading name between opening and closing table tags.
To insert data in the table, td tags are used.
Table headings and table data are entered row-wise.

7. Styling in HTML(styling.html):
   In this document, I have used all types of styling, i.e.,
   
(i) Inline styling: In this styling, style tag is written inside that tag itself like h1 or p where you want to style, and styling is reflected in that part only.

(ii) Internal styling: In this type, style tag is written inside head tag and every part such as h1, body or paragraph is given its respective properties inside it.

(iii) External styling: In this, a separate CSS file is created and all styling properties are written in it. Then this file is linked to that HTML document where you want to use the styles by using link tag with rel and href properties inside it.

Priority of inline styling>internal styling.
